# SolarCalc

Adaptation of NOAA solar calculations for Excel (https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/calcdetails.html). Estimates time of sunrise and sunset based on location and date. 

Currently time is returned as minutes of the day. This can be converted to a more conventional time format using the function `mins2time` in https://github.com/rasenior/ConvertDateTime.
